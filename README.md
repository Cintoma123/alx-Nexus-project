About the Project
This is a robust and scalable e-commerce platform built with Django, designed to provide a comprehensive solution for online retail. It features a modular architecture, enabling easy expansion and maintenance of various e-commerce functionalities such as user management, product catalog, order processing, payments, and shipping. The project emphasizes clean code, API-driven development, and a strong foundation for both web and mobile clients.

Features
User Authentication & Authorization: Secure user registration, login, and role-based access control.

Product Management: Create, view, update, and delete product listings with details like descriptions, images, and pricing.

Order Processing: Seamless order creation, tracking, and management.

Payment Integration: Handle various payment methods securely (integrations to be specified as they are implemented).

Shipping Management: Configure and manage shipping options and rates.

RESTful API: A well-documented API for all core functionalities, suitable for integration with front-end frameworks and mobile applications.

Database: PostgreSQL for robust data storage.

Dockerized Environment: Easy setup and consistent development/production environments using Docker.

CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment workflows (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker: Install Docker

Docker Compose: Comes with Docker Desktop installation.

Git: Install Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce_project.git
cd ecommerce_project

Create a .env file:
Copy the .env.example (if you create one, otherwise skip this) or manually create a .env file in the root directory and configure your environment variables.

cp .env.example .env # If you have an example file

Populate .env with necessary variables (e.g., DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True, database credentials).

Running Locally
Build and run Docker containers:

docker-compose up --build

This command will:

Build the Docker images for the Django application, Nginx, and PostgreSQL.

Start the services defined in docker-compose.yml.

Apply database migrations:
Once the containers are up, execute migrations within the Django container:

docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):

docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

Access the application:
The application should now be running at http://localhost:8000.
The Django Admin panel will be available at http://localhost:8000/admin/.
